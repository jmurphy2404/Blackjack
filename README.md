# Blackjack
# Created for NYCDA JS Capstone

## Purpose and Learning Objectives
```
To practice and advance my JavaScript skills with a game that involves complex internal logic and intertwined rules, 
as well as exploring accurate deck shuffling and randomizing mechanics. The game contains the option to double down, 
hit, stand, etc., all the standard blackjack actions, except splitting, as it only supports one hand versus the dealer 
at a time currently. The artwork is ASCII style in homage to the retro aesthetic of early PC games from my youth.
